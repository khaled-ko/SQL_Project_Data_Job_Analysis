3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
    10
```

- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.

- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH
    top_paying_jobs
AS
    (
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN
    company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
AND
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
    10
    )

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```

- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.

- **Python** follows closely with a bold count of 7.

INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT
    5
```

- **SQL** and **Excel** remain fundamental, emphasizing the need for strong foundational skills in data processing and spreadsheet manipulation.

### 4. Skills Based on Salary
Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    round ( avg (salary_year_avg) ) as avg_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN
    skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
